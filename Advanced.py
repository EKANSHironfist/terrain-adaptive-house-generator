"""### Generate a world of make-believe.

This file contains a comprehensive collection of functions designed
to introduce coders to the more involved aspects of the GDMC HTTP client.

The source code of this module contains examples for:

World Analysis:
- Global slices
- Biomes
- Obtrusiveness and optimal direction
- Versions
- Block categories

World manipulation:
- Interfaces
- Running commands
- Manipulating build area
- Placing blocks (advanced)
- Placing geometric shapes (advanced)
- Placing lecterns, signs, blocks with inventory

Utilities:
- 2D/3D loops
- Book writing

Optimisation:
- Keeping time
- Block caching
- Block buffering
- LRU Cache

If you haven't already, please take a look at Start_Here.py before continuing

NOTE: This file will be updated to reflect the latest features upon release
INFO: Should you have any questions regarding this software, feel free to visit
    the #â„¹-framework-support channel on the GDMC Discord Server
    (Invite link: https://discord.gg/V9MW65bD)
