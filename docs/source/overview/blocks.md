To get the technical ID of a block in Minecraft (like "red_concrete"),
press {keys}`F3` and point at the the block. The ID will be shown at the bottom
right, below "Targeted Block". You can leave out the "minecraft:" part.

To get the ID of a block in your inventory, you can also press {keys}`F3 + H`
and then hover over the block. The ID should be shown at the bottom of the
tooltip.

You can also "delete" a block by placing Block("air") at its position.
