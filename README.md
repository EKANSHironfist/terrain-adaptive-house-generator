## python client scripts for the Minecraft HTTP Interface Mod

This a collection of scripts for demonstrating the [Minecraft HTTP Interface Mod](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface) build for the GDMC competition.

Requirements are in requirements.txt. Feel free to use different versions, the versions are just what is installed on my machine.

You need to have Minecraft running, the mod installed and a world open for this to work!

Scripts:
